# A program is just a sequence of statements.
print 1;

# So, at the top level, you don't a compound statement
# to contain a sequence of statements.
print 2;

# But, you can use a compound statement anywhere, to make a sequence
# of statements that are parsed as just one statement.
{
  print 3;
  print 4;
}

# It would be nice to have spaces between these numbers, or a newline
# at the end.  That will require strings (a few test inptus later).
