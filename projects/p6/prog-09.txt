# By changing and testing the value of a variable, we can run a loop.

x = 0;

# The while statement just contains one statement in the body, but
# if we make it a compound statement, then we can put as much as we
# want (just like in C or Java)
while ( x < 1000 ) {
  # Print the value of x
  print x;
  print "\n";
  
  # Then, increment it.
  x = x + 1;
}
